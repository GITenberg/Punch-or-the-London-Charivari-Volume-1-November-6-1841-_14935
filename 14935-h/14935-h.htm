<h2>A DAY-DREAM AT MY UNCLE&rsquo;S.</h2>
<p>The result of a serious conversation between the authors of my
being ended in the resolution that it was high time for me to begin
the world, and do something for myself. The only difficult problem
left for them to solve was, in what way I had better commence. One
would have thought the world had nothing in its whole construction
but futile beginnings and most unsatisfactory methods of doing for
one&rsquo;s self. Scheme after scheme was discussed and discarded;
new plans were hot-beds for new doubts; and impossibilities seemed
to overwhelm every succeeding though successless suggestion. At the
critical moment when it appeared perfectly clear to me either that
I was fit for nothing or nothing was fit for me, the authoritative
&ldquo;rat-tat&rdquo; of the general postman closed the argument,
and for a brief space distracted the intense contemplations of my
bewildered parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought it?&rdquo; and various other
disjointed mutterings escaped my father, forming a sort of running
commentary upon the document under his perusal. Having duly
devoured the contents, he spread the sheet of paper carefully out,
re-wiped his spectacles, and again commenced the former
all-engrossing subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, my boy, you are all right, and this will do for you.
Here&rsquo;s a letter from your uncle Ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; continued my father, with increasing
emphasis and peculiar dignity, &ldquo;Ticket&mdash;the great
Ticket&mdash;the greatest&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pawnbroker in London,&rdquo; said I, finishing the
sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he is; and what of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing further; I don&rsquo;t much like the trade,
but&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s your uncle, sir. It&rsquo;s a glorious
money-making business. He offers to take you as an apprentice.
Nancy, my love, pack up this lad&rsquo;s things, and start him off
by the mail to-morrow. Go to bed, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the die was cast! The mail was punctual; and I was duly
delivered to Ticket&mdash;the great Ticket&mdash;my maternal, and
everybody else&rsquo;s undefinable, uncle. Duly equipped in glazed
calico sleeves, and ditto apron, I took my place behind the
counter. But as it was discovered that I had a peculiar
<em>penchant</em> for giving ten shillings in exchange for gilt
sixpences, and encouraging all sorts of smashing by receiving
counterfeit crowns, half-crowns, and shillings, I received a box on
the ear, and a positive command to confine myself to the up-stairs,
or &ldquo;top-of-the-spout department&rdquo; for the future. Here
my chief duties were to deposit such articles as progressed up that
wooden shaft in their respective places, and by the same means
transmit the &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; to the shop below. This was but
dull work, and in the long dreary evenings, when partial darkness
(for I was allowed no candle) seemed to invite sleep, I frequently
fell into a foggy sort of mystified somnolency&mdash;the partial
prostration of my corporeal powers being amply compensated by the
vague wanderings of indistinct imagination.</p>
<p>In these dozing moods some of the parcels round me would appear
not only imbued with life, but, like the fabled animals of
&AElig;sop, blessed with the gift of tongues. Others, though
speechless, would conjure up a vivid train of breathing tableaux,
replete with their sad histories. That tiny relic, half the size of
the small card it is pinned upon, swells like the imprisoned genie
the fisherman released from years of bondage, and the shadowy
vapour takes once more a form. From the small circle of that
wedding ring, the tear-fraught widow and the pallid orphan, closely
dogged by Famine and Disease, spring to my sight. That brilliant
tiara opens the vista of the rich saloon, and shows the humbled
pride of the titled hostess, lying excuses for her absent gems. The
flash contents of that bright yellow handkerchief shade forth the
felon&rsquo;s bar; the daring burglar eyeing with confidence the
counsel learned in the law&rsquo;s defects, fee&rsquo;d by its
produce to defend its quondam owner. The effigies of Pride,
Extravagance, honest Distress, and reckless Plunder, all by turns
usurp the scene. In my last waking sleep, just as I had composed
myself in delicious indolence, a parcel fell with more than
ordinary force on one beneath. These were two of my talking
friends. I stirred not, but sat silently to listen to their curious
conversation, which I now proceed to give verbatim.</p>
<p><em>Parcel fallen upon</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;What the d&mdash;l are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Parcel that fell</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? I rather think its mine, though. Why don&rsquo;t
you look where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I see through three brown papers and a rusty
black silk handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there a hole in any of &lsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity; but when you&rsquo;ve been here as
long as I have, the moths will help you a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope if you like; but you&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;m
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I didn&rsquo;t hurt you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very. Bless you, I&rsquo;m pretty well used to
ill-treatment now. You&rsquo;ve only rubbed the pile of my collar
the wrong way, just as that awkward black rascal would brush
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me! I think I know your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I think I know yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t Colonel Tomkins, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor Count Castor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m in error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not. I was the Colonel once; then I
became the Count by way of loan; and then I came here&mdash;as he
said by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, I&rsquo;m delighted to speak to you.
How did you wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first saw you, I thought you the handsomest
Petersham in town. Your velvet collar, cuffs, and side-pockets,
were superb; and when you were the Colonel, upon my life you were
the sweetest cut thing about the waist and tails I ever walked
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can return the compliment; for a blue, with
chased buttons and silk lining, you beat anything I ever had the
honour of meeting. But I suppose, as you are here, you are not the
Cornet now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. His scoundrel of a valet disgraced his
master&rsquo;s cloth and me at the same time. The villain went to
the Lowther Arcade&mdash;took me with him by force. Fancy my agony;
literally accessory to handing ices to milliners&rsquo; apprentices
and staymakers; and when the wretch commenced quadrilling it, he
dos-a-dos&rsquo;d me up against a fat soap-boiler&rsquo;s wife, in
filthy three-turned-and-dyed common satin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rascal! But he was discovered&mdash;he reeled home drunk.
<em>I</em>, that is, as it&rsquo;s known, <em>we</em> make the men.
The Cornet saw him, and thrashed him soundly with a three-foot
Crowther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been delightful to your
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? revenge is sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is; but as the Cornet forgot to order him to take
me off, I got the worst of the drubbing. I was dreadfully cut
about. Two buttons fearfully lacerated&mdash;nothing but the shanks
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The valet mentioned something about wages and assault
warrants, so I was given to him to make the matter up. Between you
and I, the Cornet was very hard up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain of it. You remember the French-grey trousers we
used to walk out with&mdash;those he strapped so tight over the
remarkably chatty and pleasant French-polished boots whose broken
English we used to admire so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do; they were the most charming greys I ever
met. They beat the plaids into fits; and the plaids were far from
ungentlemanly, only they would always talk with a sham Scotch
accent, and quote the &lsquo;Cotter&rsquo;s Saturday
Night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly that was a drawback. But to return to our
friends, and the Cornet&rsquo;s friends, they must have been bad,
for those very greys were seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, I assure you. My tails were pinned over the patch
for three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they bear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shockingly. A general break up of the
constitution&mdash;went all to pieces. First, decay appeared in the
brace buttons; then the straps got out of order. They did say it
was owing to the heels of the French-polished boots going down on
one side, but the boots would never admit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came from the Bench for eggs and bacon for the Cornet
and his Valet&rsquo;s breakfast! What brought you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Count&rsquo;s landlady, for a week&rsquo;s
rent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you fetch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guinea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, you must have worn well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; hold your tongue&mdash;I think I shall die with
laughing,&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;When they took me in, I returned the
compliment. I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuffed and collared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; shouted both coats; and &ldquo;Ha!
ha!&rdquo; shouted I; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll teach you to &lsquo;ha!
ha!&rsquo; and neglect your business&rdquo; shouted the Governor;
and the reality of a stunning box on the ear dispelled the illusion
of my &ldquo;Day-dream at my Uncle&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<h4>SHOWS WHAT&rsquo;S AFTER A PARTY, AND WHAT&rsquo;S IN A
NAME.</h4>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/017-01.png"><img src=

id="img017-01" name="img017-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">U</span>ndoubtedly on the following day 24
Pleasant-terrace was the most uncomfortable place in the universe.
Some one has said that wherever Pleasure is, Pain is certain not to
be far off; and the truth of the allegory is never better
exemplified than on the day after &ldquo;a most delightful
party.&rdquo; We can only compare it to the morning succeeding a
victory by which the conqueror has gained a great deal of glory at
a very considerable expenditure of <em>mat&eacute;riel</em>. Let us
accompany the mistress of the house as she proceeds from room to
room, to ascertain the damage done by the enemy upon the furniture
and decorations. A light damask curtain is found to have been
saturated with port wine; a ditto chair-cushion has been doing duty
as a dripping-pan to a cluster of wax-lights; a china shepherdess,
having been brought into violent collision with the tail of a
raging lion on the mantel-piece, has reduced the noble beast to the
short-cut condition of a Scotch colley. A broken candle has
perversely fallen the only way in which it could have done any
damage, and has thrown the quicksilver on the back of a large
looking-glass into an alarming state of eruption. The return of
&ldquo;cracked and broken&rdquo; presents a fearful list of
smashage and fracture: <em>the best</em> tea-set is rendered unfit
for active service, being minus two saucers, a cup-handle, and a
milk-jug; the green and gold dessert-plates have been frightfully
reduced in numbers; two fiddle-handle spoons are completely
<em>hors de combat</em>, having been placed under the legs of the
supper-table to keep it steady; seven straw-stemmed wine-glasses
awfully shattered during the &ldquo;three-times-three&rdquo;
discharge in honour of the toast of the Heir of Applebites; four
cut tumblers injured past recovery in a fit of
&ldquo;entusymusy&rdquo; by four young gentlemen who were
accidentally left by themselves in the supper-room; eighteen
silver-plated dessert-knives reduced to the character of saws, by a
similar number of &ldquo;nice fellows&rdquo; who were endeavouring
to do the agreeable with the champagne, and consequently could
distinguish no difference between wire and grape-stalks. The
destruction in the kitchen had been equally great: the extra waiter
had placed his heel on a ham-sandwich, and, consequently, sat down
rather hurriedly on the floor with a large tray of sundries in his
lap, the result of which was, according to the following</p>
<h4>OFFICIAL RETURN,</h4>

</table>
<p>The day after a party is certain to be a sloppy day; and as the
street-door is constantly being opened and shut, a raw, rheumatical
wind is ever in active operation. Both these miseries were
consequent upon the Applebite festivities, and Agamemnon saw a
series of catarrhs enter the house as the rout-stools made their
exit. He was quite right; for the next fortnight neck-of-mutton
broth was the standard bill of fare, only varied by tea, gruel, and
toast-and-water.</p>
<p>There is no evil without its attendant good; and the temporary
imprisonment of the Applebite family induced them to consider the
propriety of naming the infant heir, for hitherto he had been
called &ldquo;the cherub,&rdquo; &ldquo;the sweet one,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the mother&rsquo;s duck of the world,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;daddy&rsquo;s darling.&rdquo; Several names had been
suggested by the several friends and relatives of the family, but
nothing decisive had been agreed to.</p>
<p>Agamemnon wished his heir to be called Isaac, after his
grandfather, the member for Puddingbury, &ldquo;in the hope,&rdquo;
as he expressed himself, &ldquo;that he might in after years be
stimulated to emulate the distinguished talents and virtues of his
great ancestor.&rdquo; (Overruled by Mrs. Waddledot, Mrs.
Applebite, and the rest of the ladies. Isaac declared vulgar,
except in the case of the member for Puddingbury.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Waddledot was anxious that the boy should be christened
Roger de Dickey, after her mother&rsquo;s great progenitor, who was
said to have come over with William the Conqueror, but whether in
the capacity of a lacquey or a lord-in-waiting was never, and
perhaps never will be, determined. (Opposed by Agamemnon, on the
ground that ill-natured people would be sure to dispense with the
De, and his heir would be designated as Roger Dickey. In this
opinion Mrs. Applebite concurred.)</p>
<p>The lady-mother was still more perplexing; she proposed that he
should be called&mdash;</p>
<p>ALBERT (we give her own reasons)&mdash;because the Queen&rsquo;s
husband was so named.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON&mdash;because of the alliteration and his papa.</p>
<p>DAVIS&mdash;because an old maiden lady who was independent had
said that she thought it a good name for a boy, as her own was
Davis.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE&mdash;because it was a nice-sounding name, and the one
she intended to address him by in general conversation.</p>
<p>COLLUMPSION&mdash;as her papa.</p>
<p>PHIPPS&mdash;because she had had a dream in which a number of
bags or gold were marked P.H.I.P.P.S.; and</p>
<p>APPLEBITE&mdash;as a matter of course.</p>
<p>(Objected to by Mrs. Waddledot, for&mdash;nothing in particular,
and by Agamemnon on the score of economy. The heir being certain to
employ a lawyer, would be certain to pay an enormous interest in
that way alone.)</p>
<p>Friends were consulted, but without any satisfactory result; and
at length it was agreed that the names should be written upon
strips of paper and drawn by the nominees. The necessary
arrangements being completed, the three proceeded to the
ballot.</p>
<table summary="names drawn" style="width:80%; margin:auto;">

<td>Mrs. Waddledot</td>

<tr>
<td>Agamemnon</td>

<td>Roger de Dickey.</td>

<tr>
<td>Mrs. Applebite</td>

<td>Phipps.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>As a matter of course everybody was dissatisfied; but with a
&ldquo;stern virtue&rdquo; everybody kept it to themselves, and the
heir was accordingly christened Isaac Roger de Dickey Phipps
Applebite.</p>
<p>Old John soon realised Agamemnon&rsquo;s fears of Mrs.
Waddledot&rsquo;s selection, for, whether the patronym of the
Norman invader was more in accordance with his own ideas of
propriety, or was more readily suggestive to his mind of the infant
heir, he was continually speaking of little master Dicky; and upon
being remonstrated with upon the subject promised amendment for the
future. All, however, was of no use, for John jumbled the Phipps,
the Roger, the Dickey, and the De together, but always contriving
most perversely to</p>

<h2>THE FIRE AT THE TOWER.</h2>
<p>This is a sad business, there is no doubt, and the excitement
which prevailed may probably excuse the eccentricities that
occurred, and to which we beg leave to call the public
attention.</p>
<p>In the first place, by way of ensuring the safety of the
property, precautions were taken to shut out every one from the
building; and as military rule knows of no exception, the orders
given were executed to the letter by preventing the ingress of the
firemen with their engines until the general order of exclusion was
followed by a countermand. This of course took time, leaving the
fire to devour at its leisure the enormous meal that fate had
prepared for it.</p>
<p>After the admission of the firemen there was the usual mishap of
no water where it could be got at, but an abundant supply where
there was no possibility of reaching it. The tanks which the hose
could be got into were almost dry, while the Thames was in the most
provoking way almost overflowing its banks in the very
neighbourhood of the fire; and yet, if the pipes were laid on to
the water, they were laid off too far from the building to have the
least effect upon it.</p>
<p>The next eccentricity consisted in the sudden idea that
suggested itself to somebody, that all energy should be devoted to
saving the jewels, which were not in the smallest danger, and even
if they had been, there was nobody knew how to get at them, the key
being some miles off in the possession of the Lord Chamberlain. It
might as well have been at the bottom of the Thames; and, of
course, everybody began tugging at the iron bars, which were at
length forced, and the jewels were, at a great cost of time and
trouble, removed <em>to a place of safety</em> from <em>a position
of the most perfect security!!</em> However, this showed activity
if nothing else, and of course made the subject of paragraphs about
&ldquo;presence of mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;indefatigable
exertions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;superhuman efforts&rdquo; on the part
of certain persons who, for the good they were doing, might just as
well have been carrying the piece of artillery in St. James&rsquo;s
Park into the enclosure opposite.</p>
<p>While the jewels were being hurried from one part of the Tower,
where they were quite safe, to another where they were not more so,
it never occurred to any one to rescue from danger the arms, which
were being quietly consumed, while the crown and regalia were being
jolted about with the most injurious activity.</p>
<p>The treatment of some of the reporters was another curious point
of this melancholy business; and a gentleman from a weekly journal,
on applying at head-quarters, found his own head suddenly quartered
by a blow from a musket. This was rather unceremonious treatment on
the part of the privates of the line to a person who is also</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/017-04.png"><img src=

<p>ATTACHED TO THE LINE.</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;the penny-a-line we mean; but with a true <em>gusto</em>
for accidents, and a relish for calamities, which nothing could
subdue, he still pressed forward, with blood streaming from his
fractured skull, for additional particulars. The American reporter
whose hand was blown off, and had the good fortune to be upon the
spot, is not to be compared with the hero who had the exclusive
advantage of being able to supply practical information of the
ruffianly conduct pursued by the soldiery.</p>
<p>It is not stated whether the fire-escape was on the spot; but as
no one lived in the building that was burnt, it is highly probable
that every effort was made to save the lives of the inhabitants.
There is no doubt that the ladder was strenuously directed towards
the clock tower, with the view, probably, of saving the
&ldquo;jolly cock&rdquo; who used to adorn the top of it.</p>
<p>The reporters mark as a miracle the extraordinary fact, that
during the whole time of the fire, the weathercock continued to
vary with the wind. The gentlemen of the press, probably, expected
that the awful solemnity of the scene would have rendered any man,
not entirely lost to every sense of feeling, completely motionless.
The apathy of the weathercock that went on whirling about as if
nothing had happened, is in the highest degree disgusting, and we
can scarcely regret the fate of such an unfeeling animal.</p>

<h3>PLEASE TO REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER.</h3>
<p>November, that month of fires, fogs, <em>felo de ses</em>, and
Fawkes, has been ushered in with becoming ceremony at the Tower and
at various other parts of the metropolis. In vain has an Act of
Parliament been passed for the suppression of
bonfires&mdash;November asserts her rights, and will have her
modicum of &ldquo;flare up&rdquo; in spite of the law; but with the
trickery of an Old Bailey barrister she has thrown the onus upon
October. Nor is this all! Like a traitorous Eccalobeion she has
already hatched several conspiracies, as though everybody now
thought of getting rid of others or themselves.</p>
<p>The Right Hon. Spring-heel Rice Baron Jamescrow, commonly known
as the Lord Monteagle, has, like his historical synonym, been
favoured with a communication which being considerably beyond his
own comprehension, he has in a laudable spirit submitted it to
Punch&mdash;an evidence of wisdom which we really did not expect
from our friend Baron Jamescrow.</p>
<p>We subjoin the introductory epistle&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR PUNCH,&mdash;I hasten to forward you the awful letter
enclosed&mdash;we are all abroad here concerning it&mdash;by the
bye, how are you all at home&mdash;to say the least, it certainly
does look very ugly. Mrs. P., I hope, has improved in appearance.
Something terrible is evidently about to happen. I intend to pay
you a visit shortly. I trust we may not have to encounter any more
Guys&mdash;you may expect to see me on my Friday. I can only add my
prayers for the nation&rsquo;s safety and my compliments to Mrs.
Punch and the young P.s.</p>
<p class="rgt">Yours ever,<br />
MONTEAGLE.</p>
<p>P.S. Let me have your advice and your last Number immediately I
have made a few notes, and paid the postage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is the letter referred to by the Baron
Jamescrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MY LORD,&mdash;Being known to some of your friends I would
advise you, as you tender your peace and quiet, to devise some
excuse to shift off your attendance at your house (clearly the
House of Lords&mdash;<em>Monteagle</em>), for fire and brimstone
have united to destroy the enemies of man (evidently gunpowder,
lucifer-matches, and the Peers&mdash;<em>Monteagle</em>). Think not
lightly of my advertisement (see <em>Dispatch</em>), but retire
yourself in the country (I should think I
would&mdash;<em>Monteagle</em>), where you may abide in safety; for
though there be no appearance of any <em>pun&aelig;</em>; (what the
deuce does this mean? Puny&rsquo;s
little&mdash;<em>Monteagle</em>), yet they will receive a terrible
blow-up (By pun&aelig; he means members of Parliament, and he
<em>is</em> another Guy!&mdash;<em>Monteagle</em>); yet they shall
not see who hurts them, though the place shall be purified and the
enemy completely destroyed.</p>
<p class="rgt">I am, your Lordship&rsquo;s servant,<br />
and destroyer to her Majesty and the two Houses of
Parliament.<br />
T.I.F. Fin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are surprised at our friend Monteagle troubling us with a
matter evidently as plain as the nose on our own face. It requires
neither a Solon nor a Punch to solve the enigma. It is merely a
letter from Tiffin, the bug destroyer to her Majesty, and refers to
his peculiar plan of persecuting the <em>pun&aelig;</em>.</p>
<p>We have no doubt that Lords and Commons will be blown up on the
re-assembling of Parliament; and as an assurance that we do not
speak upon conjecture only, we beg to subjoin a portrait of the
delinquent.</p>

<h2>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES.</h2>
<p>Be not afraid, gentle reader, that, from the title of our
present article, we are about to prescribe for you any political
draught. No! be assured that we know as little about politics as
pyrotechny&mdash;that we are as blissfully ignorant of all that
relates to the science of government as that of
gastronomy&mdash;and have ever since our boyhood preferred the
solid consistency of gingerbread to the crisp insipidity of
parliament. The candidates of whom we write were no would-be
senators&mdash;no sprouting Ciceros or embryo
Demosthenes&rsquo;&mdash;they were no aspirants for the grand
honour of representing the honest and independent stocks and stones
of some ancient rotten borough, or, what is about the same thing,
the enlightened ten-pound voters of some modern reformed
one&mdash;they were not ambitious of the proud privilege of
appending for seven years two letters to their names, and of
franking some half-dozen others <em>per diem</em>. No! the rivals
who form the theme of our present paper were emulous of obtaining
no place in Parliament, but, what is far more desirable, a place in
the affections of a lovely maid. They sought not for the suffrages
of the unwashed, but for the smiles of a fair one,&mdash;they
neither desired to be returned as the representative of so many
sordid voters for the term of seven years (a term of transportation
common alike to M.P.s and pickpockets), but for the more permanent
honour of being elected as the partner of a certain lady for
life.</p>
<p>Georgiana Gray was the lovely object of the rivalry of the above
candidates; and a damsel more eminently qualified to be the
innocent cause of contention could not be found within the whole
catalogue of those dear destructive little creatures who, from Eve
downwards, have always possessed a peculiar patent for
mischief-making. Georgiana was as handsome as she was rich. She
was, in the superlative sense of the word, a beauty, and&mdash;what
ought to be written in letters of gold&mdash;an heiress. She had
the figure of a sylph, and the purse of a nabob. Her face was
lovely and animated enough to enrapture a Raffaelle, and her
fortune ample enough to captivate a Rothschild. She had a clear
rent-roll of 20,000<em>l</em>. per annum,&mdash;and a pair of eyes
that, independent of her other attractions, were sufficiently
fascinating to seduce Diogenes himself into matrimony.</p>
<p>Philosophers generally affirm that the only substance capable of
producing a magnetic effect is steel; but had they been witnesses
of the great attraction that the fortune of our fair heroine had
for its many eager pursuers, they would doubtless have agreed with
us that the metal possessing the greatest possible power of
magnetism is decidedly&mdash;gold. Innumerable were the butterflies
that were drawn towards the lustre of the lovely Georgiana&rsquo;s
money; and many a suitor, who set a high value upon his personal
qualifications, might be found at her side endeavouring to persuade
its pretty possessor of the eligible investment that might be made
of the property in himself. Report, however, had invidiously
declared that Georgiana looked with a cold and contemptuous eye
upon the addresses of all save two.</p>
<p>Augustus Peacock and Julius Candy (this enviable duo) were two
such young men as may be met with in herds any fine afternoon
publishing their persons to the frequenters of Regent-street. They
did credit to their tailors, who were liberal enough to give them
credit in return. Their coats were guiltless of a wrinkle, their
gloves immaculate in their chastity, and their boots resplendent in
their brilliancy. Indeed they were human annuals&mdash;splendidly
bound, handsomely embellished&mdash;but replete with nothing but
fashionable frivolities. They never ventured out till such time as
they imagined the streets were well-aired, and were never known to
indulge in an Havannah till twelve o&rsquo;clock P.M. They were
scrupulous in their attentions to the Opera and the figurantes, and
had no objection to wear the chains of matrimony provided the links
were made of gold. In fine, they were of that common genus of
gentlemen who lounge through life, and leave nothing behind them
but a tombstone and a small six-shilling advertisement amongst the
Deaths of some morning newspaper as a record of their having
existed.</p>
<p>Such were the persons and the qualifications of the gentlemen to
whom report had assigned the possession of the hand and fortune of
the fair Georgiana Gray. But, happy as they respectively felt to be
thus singled out for the proud distinction, still the knowledge of
there being a rival in the field to dispute the glories of the
conquest materially detracted from that feeling. They had each
heard of the pretensions of the other; and while the peace of the
one was repeatedly disturbed by the panegyrics of Mr. P., the
harmony of the other met with an equal violation from the eulogies
of Mr. C.; and although their respective vanities would not allow
them to believe that the lady in question could be so deficient in
taste as to prefer any other person to their precious selves, still
it was but natural that they should neither look upon the other
with any other feeling than that of disgust at the egregious
impudence, and contempt for the superlative conceit, that could
lead any other man to enter the lists as an opponent to themselves.
Repeatedly had Mr. P. been heard to express his desire to lengthen
the olfactory organ of Mr. C.; while the latter had frequently been
known to declare that nothing would confer greater gratification
upon him than to endorse with his cane the person of Mr. P. In
fact, they hated each other with all possible cordiality.
Fortunately, however, circumstances had never brought them into
collision.</p>
<p>It was a lovely afternoon in May. All the world were returning
to town. Georgiana Gray had just forsaken Harrowgate and its
waters, to participate in the thickening gaieties of the
metropolis. Augustus Peacock had abandoned the moors of Scotland
for the beauties of Almack&rsquo;s; and Julius Candy had hastened
from the banks of the Wye for the fascinations of Taglioni and the
Opera.</p>
<p>The first object of Augustus on returning to town was to hasten
and pay his devoirs to <em>his</em> intended. With this intent he
proceeded to the mansion of Georgiana, and was ushered into the
drawing-room, with the assurance that the lady would be with him
immediately. The servant, however, had no sooner quitted the
apartment than Mr. Candy, actuated by a similar motive, knocked at
the door, and was speedily conducted into the presence of his
rival.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen, being mutually ignorant of the person of the
other, bowed with all the formality usual to a first
introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day, sir,&rdquo; said Augustus Peacock, after a
short pause, little aware that he was holding communion with his
rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;very fine, sir,&rdquo; returned Julius Candy
with a smile, which, had he been conscious of the person he was
addressing, would instantly have been converted into a most
contemptuous sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had the pleasure of seeing Miss Gray, sir, since
her return from Harrowgate?&rdquo; inquired Augustus, with the soft
civility of a man of fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;I have not yet had that honour, sir;
no,&rdquo;&mdash;replied Julius, with a slight inclination of his
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming girl, sir,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Peacock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fascinating creature,&rdquo; responded Mr. Candy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see <em>such</em> eyes, sir?&rdquo;
continued Mr. P.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! &rsquo;pon my honour!
never!&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed Julius, in a tone of moderate
enthusiasm. &ldquo;You may call <em>them</em> eyes, sir,&rdquo; and
here he elevated his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively provoking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; languishingly remarked Augustus,
&ldquo;he will be a happy may who gets possession of such a
treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, indeed, sir,&rdquo; returned his unknown rival,
with an air of self-satisfaction, as if he believed that happiness
was likely to be his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are aware, I suppose, sir,&rdquo; proceeded the
communicative Mr. Peacock, &ldquo;that there is a certain party
whom Miss Gray looks upon with particular favour&rdquo;&mdash;and
the gentleman, to give peculiar emphasis to the remark, slightly
elevated his cravat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I ought to be&rdquo;&mdash;pointedly
returned Mr. C.&mdash;simpering somewhat diffidently at the idea
that the observation was levelled at himself.</p>
<p>The two rivals looked at each other, tittered, and bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes&mdash;I dare say&mdash;observed it, no
doubt!&rdquo; said Augustus, when his emotion had subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;I should have been blind indeed could I
have failed to remark it,&rdquo; responded Julius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re right&mdash;yes&mdash;Miss
Gray&rsquo;s attentions have been particularly marked,
certainly&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been, sir, very, <em>very</em>
marked&mdash;she&rsquo;s quite taken, poor thing, I
believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor creature!&mdash;sadly smitten indeed!&mdash;The
lady has confessed as much to you perhaps, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Candy looked surprised at the remark of his companion, and
replied &ldquo;Why really, sir, that is a question
which&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I beg pardon, I was wrong&mdash;yes, I ought to
have considered&mdash;but candidly, sir, what do you think of the
match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my honour, my dear sir,&rdquo; exclaimed
Julius most feelingly, colouring slightly at the question, which he
thought was rather home-thrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, to be sure, it is rather a delicate question,
considering, you know, that one is in the presence of the party
himself, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, <em>very</em> delicate, I can assure you,&rdquo;
said Julius, who, &ldquo;laying the flattering unction to his
soul&rdquo; that he was the party alluded to, thought it rather an
indelicate one.</p>
<p>Augustus observed the embarrassment of his companion, and could
not refrain from laughter, and turning round to his companion,
enquired significantly, &ldquo;whether he did not think he was a
happy man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julius, who was in a measure similarly affected by the
excitement of his unknown friend, observed, that the gentleman
certainly did seem of a peculiarly gay disposition; and the two
rivals, each delighted with the fancied approval of his suit by the
other, indulged a mutual cachinnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; after a slight pause remarked Augustus,
with apparently perfect indifference, &ldquo;you are aware that
there was a rival in the field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ah! did hear of a fellow,&rdquo; responded Julius,
with equal <em>insouciance</em>, &ldquo;but the idea of any other
man carrying off the prize, perfectly ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! absolutely ludicrous, &rsquo;pon my soul! Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is astonishing the confounded vanity of some
people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their preposterous obtuseness! why, a man with half
an eye might see the folly of such presumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, stupid dolt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impudent puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conceited fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow must be out of his senses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a horsewhipping perhaps might bring him
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, or a good kicking might be salutary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unanimity of the rival candidates produced, as might be
supposed from their ignorance of the pretensions of each other, a
feeling of mutual satisfaction and friendship, which, after a
volley of anathemas had been fired by each gentleman against his
rival, in absolute unconsciousness of <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page197" name="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>his presence,
ultimately displayed itself by each of them rising from his chair,
and shaking the other most energetically by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Augustus in an
inordinate fit of enthusiasm, at the supposed sympathy of his
companion, &ldquo;I never met with a gentleman so peculiarly to my
fancy as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feeling is perfectly reciprocal, believe me, my dear
sir,&rdquo; returned Julius, equally delighted with the imagined
friendship of Mr. P.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that our acquaintance will not end
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be most proud to cultivate it, I can assure
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to present you with a card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be too happy to exchange it for one of my
own!&rdquo; and so saying, the parties searched for their
cases&mdash;Mr. P., in the mean time, protesting his gratification
&ldquo;to meet with a gentleman whose opinions so thoroughly
coincided with his own,&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. C. as emphatically
declaring &ldquo;that he should ever consider this the most
fortunate occurrence of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, I shall be most happy to see you at any
time,&rdquo; observed Mr. Augustus Peacock, smiling as he placed
the small oblong of cardboard which bore his name and address in
the hand of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall feel too proud if you will honour me with a call
at your earliest convenience,&rdquo; said Mr. Julius Candy bowing,
while he presented to his fancied friend the little pasteboard
parallelogram inscribed with his title and residence.</p>
<p>The eyes of the two gentlemen, however, were no sooner directed
to the cards, which had been placed in their hands, than the smiles
which had previously gladdened their countenances were
instantaneously changed into expressions of the most indignant
scorn and surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peacock!&rdquo; shouted Candy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candy!&rdquo; vociferated Peacock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the furious Mr. P., &ldquo;had I
known that Candy was the name of the man, sir, whom I was
addressing, sir, my conduct you would have found, sir, of a very
different character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had I been aware,&rdquo; retorted the exasperated Mr.
C., &ldquo;that Peacock was the title of the <em>fellow</em>&rdquo;
(and he laid a forty-horse power of emphasis upon the word)
&ldquo;with whom I have been conversing, my card would never have
been delivered to him but with a different motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow, sir! I think you said&mdash;<em>Fellow</em>,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, sir,&mdash;fellow was the word I used, and I
repeat it&mdash;fellow&mdash;fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, sir! and I throw back in your teeth, sir, with
the addition of fool, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&mdash;no, no&mdash;not quite a fool&mdash;only
<em>near</em> one, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a conceited puppy, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are an impudent scoundrel, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought matters to a crisis. The parties embraced their
canes with more than ordinary ardour, and, by their lowering looks,
indicated a fervent desire to violate the peace of her blessed
Majesty, when the fair cause of their contention suddenly entered
the apartment.</p>
<p>It was no difficult matter, in the positions they occupied, for
Georgiana to divine the reason of their animosity; which she
effectually allayed by informing the angry disputants, &ldquo;that
either had no reason to look upon the other with any degree of
jealousy, for she humbly begged to assure them that her affections
were devoted to&mdash;<em>neither</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, of course, put a full stop to their chivalry: each party
seized his hat, bowing distantly to the insensible Georgiana, and
left the house, vowing certain destruction to the other; but, upon
cool reflection, Messrs. C. and P. doubtless deemed it advisable
not to endanger the small quantum of brains they individually
possessed, by fighting for a lady who was so utterly blind to their
manifold merits.</p>
<p>Thus ended the feud of THE RIVAL CANDIDATES.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SIR FRANCIS BURDETT&rsquo;S VISIT TO THE TOWER.</h3>
<p>On the news of the fire in the Tower of London being told to Sir
Francis Burdett, he hurried to the scene of the conflagration,
which must have suggested some unpleasing reminiscences of his lost
popularity and faded glory. Some thirty years ago, those very walls
received him like a second Hampden, the undaunted defender of his
country&rsquo;s rights;&mdash;on last Monday he entered them a
broken-down unhonoured parasite. Gazing on the black and
smouldering ruins before him&mdash;he perhaps compared them to his
own patriotism, for he was heard to matter audibly&mdash;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/017-06.png"><img src=
"images/017-06.png" alt="A man brushes his thinning hair." id=

<p>CAN IT BE THAT THIS IS ALL REMAINS OF THEE?</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>REFORM YOUR LAWYERS&rsquo; BILLS.</h3>
<p>It is a well-known and established fact, that nothing so far
conduces to the domestic happiness of all circles as the golden
system of living within one&rsquo;s income. Luxuries cease to be so
if after-reflection produces vexatious results; comfort flies
before an exorbitant and unprepared-for demand; and the debtor
dunned by the merciless creditor sinks into something worse than a
cipher, as nothingness is denied him, and the <em>one</em> standing
before him but aggravates, and multiplies his painful annoyances.
The great secret of satisfactory existence derives its origin from
well-calculated and moderate expenditure. Ten thousand a year
renders pines cheap at 1<em>l</em>. 11<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>. per
pound; ten hundred is better exemplified by Ribston pippins!</p>
<p>So in all grades are there various matters of taste which become
extravagance if rushed into by persons unbreeched for the occasion.
Luckily for the present day, the tastes of the gourmand and epicure
are merged in more manly sports; the great class of Corinthian
aristocrats cull sweets from the blackened eyes of
policemen&mdash;raptures from wrenched-off knockers&mdash;merriment
in contusions&mdash;and frantic delight in fractured limbs! These
innocent amusements have in their prosecution plunged many of their
thoughtless and high-spirited devotees into pecuniary difficulties,
simply from their ignorance of the costs attendant upon such
exciting, fashionable, and therefore highly proper amusements.</p>
<p>Ever anxious to ameliorate the suffering and persecuted of ail
classes, Messrs. Quibble and Quirk, attorneys-at-law, beg to offer
their professional services at the following fixed and equitable
rate,&mdash;they, Messrs. Q. and Q., pledging themselves that on no
occasion shall the charge exceed the sum opposite the particular
amusement in the following list.</p>

<p class="cen">N.B. Five per cent, per annum taken off for terms of

<h3>&ldquo;WHEN VULCAN FORGED,&rdquo; &amp;c.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; said Sir Peter Laurie, rushing into
the Justice-room the morning the Exchequer Bill affair was
discovered, and seizing Hobler by the button; &ldquo;This is a
dreadful business. Have you any idea, Hobler, who the delinquent
is?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why really, Sir Peter, &rsquo;tis difficult to
say; but from an inspection of the <em>forged</em> instruments I
should say it was <em>Smith&rsquo;s work</em>.&rdquo; Sir Peter
felt the importance of the suggestion, and rushed off to Sir Robert
Peel to recommend the stoppage of all the forges in the
kingdom.</p>

<h2>PEEL&rsquo;S PRE-EXISTENCE!</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Every man is not only himself,&rdquo; says Sir THOMAS
BROWNE; &ldquo;there hath been many Diogenes, and as many Timons,
though but few of that name. <em>Men are lived over again</em>. The
world is now as it was in ages past: there was none then but there
hath been some one since that parallels him, and, as it were,
<em>his revived self</em>.&rdquo; We are devout believers in the
creed.</p>
<p>HERR VON TEUFELSKOPF was a High German doctor, of the first
class. He had taken his diploma of Beelzebub in the Black Forest,
and was gifted with as fine a hand to force a card&mdash;with as
glib a tongue to harangue a mob at wakes and fairs, as any
professor since the birth of the fourth grace of
life,&mdash;swindling. He would talk until his head smoked of his
list of miraculous cures&mdash;of his balsams, his anodynes, his
elixirs; in the benevolence of his soul he would, to accommodate
the pockets of the poor, sell a pennyworth of the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone; and, as a further illustration of his
sympathy for suffering man or woman, give, even for a kreutzer, a
mouthful of the Fountain of Youth. As a water-doctor, too, his
Sagacity was inconceivable. A hundred years ago, he told to a
fraction the amount of the national debt, from a single glance at
the specimen sent him by JOHN BULL; and more, for five-and-twenty
years predicted who would be the incoming Lord Mayor of London,
from an inspection of a pint of water presented to him every season
from Aldgate-pump. He could prophesy all the politics of the Court
of Aldermen from a phial filled at Fleet-ditch; and could at any
time&mdash;no trifling task&mdash;tell the amount of corruption in
the House of Commons, by taking up a handful of water at
Westminster-bridge. On his stolen visit to England&mdash;for the
honour he has done our country has never been generally
known&mdash;he calculated to a nicety how many puppies and kittens
were annually drowned in the Thames, and how many
suicides&mdash;particularising the sex and dress of each
sufferer&mdash;were committed in the same period, from a bottlefull
of Thames water brought to him wherewith to dilute his brandy at
the Ship public house, Greenwich&mdash;a hostelry much frequented
by Doctor TEUFELSKOPF. We have seen the calculation very
beautifully illuminated on ass&rsquo;s skin, and at this moment
deposited in the college of Heligoland. It is not generally known
that the Doctor died in this country; lustily predicting, however,
that after a nap of a score or so of years he would return to this
life in an entirely new character. The Doctor has kept his word.
HERR VON TEUFELSKOPF, as Sir THOMAS BROWNE says, is &ldquo;lived
over again&rdquo; in Sir ROBERT PEEL!</p>
<p>It is impossible to reflect upon the enlarged humanity of Sir
ROBERT&mdash;for though, indeed, he is no other than the old German
quack revived, we will not refuse to him his new name&mdash;toward
the sufferers of Paisley, without feeling that the fine spirit of
finesse which made the reputation of the student of the Black
Forest has in no way suffered from its long sleep; but, on the
contrary, has risen very much refreshed for new practice. The
Doctor never compassed so fine a sleight as Sir ROBERT when lately,
playing the philanthropist, he struck his breeches&rsquo; pocket
with a spasm of benevolence, and pulled therefrom&mdash;fifty
pounds! Only a few weeks before, Sir ROBERT had sworn by all his
list of former cures, that he would clothe the naked and feed the
hungry, if he were duly authorised and duly paid for such
Christian-like solicitude. He is called in; he then prorogues
Parliament to the tune of &ldquo;Go to the devil and shake
yourself,&rdquo; and sits down in the easy chair of salary, and
tries to think! Disturbed in his contemplations by the groans and
screams of the famishing, he addresses the starving multitude from
the windows of Downing-street, telling them he can do nothing for
them in a large way, but&mdash;the fee he has received to cure them
can afford as much&mdash;graciously throwing them fifty pounds from
his private compassion! As a statesman he is powerless; but he has
no objection to subscribe to the Mendicity Society.</p>
<p>It is an old hacknied abuse of NERO, that when Rome was in flame
he accompanied the crackling of doors and rafters with his very
best fiddle. We grant this showed a want of fine sympathy on the
part of NERO; there was, nevertheless, a boldness, an exhibition of
nerve, in such instrumentation. Any way, it leaves us with a higher
respect for NERO than if he had been found playing on the burning
Pantheon with a penny squirt. His mockery of the Romans, bad as it
was, was not the mockery of compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make bread cheap for you,&rdquo; says Sir ROBERT
PEEL to the Paisley sufferers; &ldquo;I will not enable you to buy
the quartern loaf at a reduced rate by your own industry, but I
will treat you to a penny roll, at its present size, from my own
purse.&rdquo; Whereupon the Tories clap their hands and cry,
&ldquo;What magnanimity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What should we say if, on another Pie-lane conflagration of
London, the Minister were to issue an order commanding all the
fire-offices to make no attempt to extinguish the flames, and were
then to exclaim to the sufferers, &ldquo;My friends, I deeply
sympathize with you; but the Ph&oelig;nix shall not budge, the
Hand-in-Hand mustn&rsquo;t move a finger, the Eagle must stay where
it is; nevertheless, there is a little private fire-engine of my
own at Tamworth; you are heartily welcome to the use of it, and
pray heaven it may put this terrible fire out, and once more make
you snug and comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quackery is of more ancient birth than many very honest people
suspect; nay, more than, were the register of its nativity laid
before their eyes, they would be willing to admit. We have no space
for its voluminous history; but it is our belief, since quackery
first plied its profitable trade with human incredulity, it never
perpetrated so successful a trick as that exhibited by Sir ROBERT
PEEL in his motion of want of confidence. The first scene of the
farce is only begun. We have seen how Sir ROBERT has snatched the
cards out of the hands of the Whigs, and shall find how he will
play the self-same trumps assorted by his opponents. A change is
already coming over the Conservatives; they are meek and mild, and,
with their pocket handkerchiefs at their eyes, lisp about the
distresses of the people. &ldquo;When the geese gaggle,&rdquo; says
a rustic saw, &ldquo;expect a change of weather.&rdquo; Lord
LONDONDERRY has already begun to talk of an alteration of the
Corn-laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what a minister may be compelled to do?&rdquo;
says Lord LONDONDERRY. These are new words for the old harridan
Toryism. She was wont, like <em>Falstaff</em>, to blow out her
cheeks and defy compulsion. But the truth is, Toryism has a new
host to contend with. Her old reign was supported by fictitious
credit&mdash;by seeming prosperity&mdash;and, more than all, by the
ignorance of the people. Well, the bills drawn by Toryism (at a
long date we grant) have now to be paid&mdash;paper is to be turned
into Bank gold. Arithmetic is a great teacher, and, with the
taxman&rsquo;s ink horn at his button-hole, gives at every door
lessons that sink into the heart of the scholar. Public opinion,
which, in the good old days &ldquo;when George the Third was
king,&rdquo; was little more than an abstraction&mdash;a thing
talked of, not acknowledged&mdash;is now a tangible presence. The
said public opinion is now formed of hundreds of thousands whose
existence, save in the books of the Exchequer, was scarcely
admitted by any reigning minister. Sir ROBERT PEEL has now to give
in his reckoning to the hard-heads of Manchester, of Birmingham, of
Leeds&mdash;he must pass his books with them, and tens of thousands
of their scholars scattered throughout the kingdom; or, three
months after the next meeting of Parliament, he is nought.</p>
<p>At this moment, it is said, Sir ROBERT is studying what taxes he
can best lay upon the people. We confess to the difficulty of the
case. At this moment there is scarcely a feather so light, the
addition of which will not crack the camel&rsquo;s back. No; Sir
ROBERT will come to the Whig measures of relief, having so
disguised them as, like <em>Plagiary&rsquo;s</em> metaphors, to
make them pass for his own. The object of himself and party is,
however, attained. He has juggled himself into place. With the
genius of his former existence, as TEUFELSKOPF, the Premier has
shuffled himself into Downing-street; and there he will leave
nothing untried that he may remain. &ldquo;If Cato gets drunk, then
is drunkenness no shame&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If Sir ROBERT PEEL
alter the Corn-laws, then is it proper that the Corn-laws should be
changed.&rdquo; This will be the cry of the Conservatives; and we
shall see men, who before would have vowed themselves to slow
starvation before they would admit an ear of wheat from Poland or
Egypt, vote for a sliding-scale or no scale at all, as their places
and the strength of their party may be best assured.</p>
<p>Doctor VON TEUFELSKOPF for years of his life was wont to eat
fire and swallow a sword. We shall see how once more Sir ROBERT
PEEL will eat his own principles&mdash;swallow his own words. When
men call this apostacy, the Doctor will blandly smile, and
denominate it a sacrifice to public opinion. We have no doubt that,
as long as he can, the Premier will put off the remedy; he will try
this and that; but at length public opinion will compel him to cast
aside his own nostrums and use RUSSELL&rsquo;S&mdash;<em>bread
pills</em>!</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>6.&mdash;OF THE GRINDER AND HIS CLASS.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/017-08.png"><img src=
"images/017-08.png" alt=
"Two people kiss through a frame in the shape of the letter O." id=
"img017-08" name="img017-08" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">O</span>ne fine morning, in the October of
the third winter session, the student is suddenly struck by the
recollection that at the end of the course the time will arrive for
him to be thinking about undergoing the ordeals of the Hall and
College. Making up his mind, therefore, to begin studying in
earnest, he becomes a <em>pro tempore</em> member of a temperance
society, pledging himself to abstain from immoderate beer for six
months: he also purchases a coffee-pot, a reading-candlestick, and
Steggall&rsquo;s Manual; and then, contriving to accumulate five
guineas to pay a &ldquo;grinder,&rdquo; he routs out his old
note-books from the bottom of his box, and commences to &ldquo;read
for the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aspirants to honours in law, physic, or divinity, each know the
value of private cramming&mdash;a process by which their brains are
fattened, by abstinence from liquids and an increase of dry food
(some of it <em>very</em> dry), like the livers of Strasbourg
geese. There are grinders in each of these three professional
classes; but the medical teacher is the man of the most varied and
eccentric knowledge. Not only is he intimately acquainted with the
different branches required to be studied, but he is also master of
all their minuti&aelig;. In accordance with the taste of the
examiners, he learns and imparts to his class at what degree of
heat water boils in a balloon&mdash;how the article of commerce,
<em>Prussian blue</em>, is more easily and correctly defined as the
<em>Ferrosesquicyanuret of the cyanide of potassium</em>&mdash;why
the nitrous oxyde, or laughing gas, induces people to make such
asses of themselves; and, especially, all sorts of individual
inquiries, which, if continued at the present rate, will range from
&ldquo;Who discovered the use of the spleen?&rdquo; to &ldquo;Who
killed cock robin?&rdquo; for aught we know. They ask questions at
the Hall quite as vague as these.</p>
<p>It is twelve o&rsquo;clock at noon. In a large room, ornamented
by shelves of bottles and preparations, with varnished prints of
medical plants and cases of articulated bones and ligaments, a
number of young men are seated round a long table covered with
baize, in the centre of whom an intellectual-looking man, whose
well-developed forehead shows the amount of knowledge it can
contain, is interrogating by turns each of the students, and
endeavouring to impress the points in question on their memories by
various diverting associations. Each of his pupils, as he passes
his examination, furnishes him with a copy of the subjects touched
upon; and by studying these minutely, the private teacher forms a
pretty correct idea of the general run of the &ldquo;Hall
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Muff,&rdquo; says the gentleman to one of his
class, handing him a bottle of something which appears like
specimens of a chestnut colt&rsquo;s coat after he had been
clipped; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cow-itch, sir,&rdquo; replies Mr. Muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cow what? You must call it at the Hall by its botanical
name&mdash;<em>dolichos pruriens</em>. What is it used
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To strew in people&rsquo;s beds that you owe a grudge
to,&rdquo; replies Muff; whereat all the class laugh, except the
last comer, who takes it all for granted, and makes a note of the
circumstance in his interleaved manual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That answer would floor you,&rdquo; continues the
grinder. &ldquo;The <em>dolichos</em> is used to destroy worms. How
does it act, Mr. Jones?&rdquo; going on to the next pupil&mdash;a
man in a light cotton cravat and no shirt collar, who looks very
like a butler out of place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It tickles them to death, sir,&rdquo; answers Mr.
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would say it acts mechanically,&rdquo; observes the
grinder. &ldquo;The fine points stick into the worms and kill them.
They say, &lsquo;Is this a dagger which I see before me?&rsquo; and
then die. Recollect the dagger, Mr. Jones, when you go up. Mr.
Manhug, what do you consider the best sudorific, if you wanted to
throw a person into a perspiration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Manhug, who is the wag of the class, finishes, in rather an
abrupt manner, a song he was humming, <em>sotto voce</em>, having
some allusion to a peer who was known as Thomas, Lord Noddy, having
passed a night at a house of public entertainment in the Old Bailey
previous to an execution. He then takes a pinch of snuff, winks at
the other pupils as much as to say, &ldquo;See me tackle him,
now;&rdquo; and replies, &ldquo;The gallery door of Covent Garden
on Boxing-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, come, be serious for once, Mr. Manhug,&rdquo;
continues the teacher; &ldquo;what else is likely to answer the
purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a run up Holborn-hill, with two Ely-place
knockers on your arm, and three policemen on your heels, might have
a good effect,&rdquo; answers Mr. Manhug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever think you will pass the Hall, if you go on at
this rate?&rdquo; observes the teacher, in a tone of mild
reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it, sir,&rdquo; returns the imperturbable
Manhug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve passed it twenty times within this last
month, and did not find any very great difficulty about it; neither
do I expect to, unless they block up Union-street and
Water-lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grinder gives Mr. Manhug up as a hopeless case, and goes on
to the next. &ldquo;Mr. Rapp, they will be very likely to ask you
the composition of the <em>compound gamboge pill</em>: what is it
made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rapp hasn&rsquo;t the least idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, then, it is composed of cambogia, aloes,
ginger, and soap&mdash;C, A, G, S,&mdash;<em>cags</em>. Recollect
Cags, Mr. Rapp. What would you do if you were sent for to a person
poisoned by oxalic acid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him some chalk,&rdquo; returns Mr. Rapp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you had not got any chalk, what would you
substitute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anything; pipeclay and soapsuds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very right; but we will presume you
could not get any pipeclay and soapsuds; in fact, that there was
nothing in the house. What would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Manhug cries out from the bottom of the
table&mdash;&ldquo;Let him die and be &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Manhug, I really must entreat of you to be more
steady,&rdquo; interrupts the professor. &ldquo;You would scrape
the ceiling with the fire-shovel, would you not? Plaster contains
lime, and lime is an antidote. Recollect that, if you please. They
like you to say you would scrape the ceiling, at the Hall: they
think it shows a ready invention in emergency. Mr. Newcome, you
have heard the last question and answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; says the fresh arrival, as he finishes
making a note of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; you are sent for, to a man who has hung himself.
What would be your first endeavour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To scrape the ceiling with the fire-shovel,&rdquo; mildly
observes Mr. Newcome; whereupon the class indulges in a hearty
laugh, and Mr. Newcome blushes as deep as the red bull&rsquo;s-eye
of a New-road doctor&rsquo;s lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would <em>you</em> do, Mr. Manhug? perhaps you can
inform Mr. Newcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut him down, sir,&rdquo; answers the indomitable
<em>farceur</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; continues the teacher; &ldquo;but we
will presume he has been cut down. What would you strive to do
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut him up, sir, if the coroner would give an order for a
<em>post mortem</em> examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had no chemistry this morning,&rdquo; observes
one of the pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Rogers; we will go on with it if you wish.
How would you endeavour to detect the presence of gold in any
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By begging the loan of a sovereign, sir,&rdquo;
interrupts Mr. Manhug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he knew you as well as I do, Manhug,&rdquo; observes
Mr. Jones, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be sure to lend it&mdash;oh,
yes!&mdash;I should rayther think so, certainly,&rdquo; whereupon
Mr. Jones compresses his nostril with the thumb of his right hand,
and moves his fingers as if he was performing a concerto on an
imaginary one handed flageolet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rapp, what is the difference between an element and a
compound body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rapp is again obliged to confess his ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A compound body is composed of two or more
elements,&rdquo; says the grinder, &ldquo;in various proportions.
Give me an example, Mr. Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-and-half is a compound body, composed of the two
elements, ale and porter, the proportion of the porter increasing
in an inverse ratio to the respectability of the public-house you
get it from,&rdquo; replies Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>The professor smiles, and taking up a Pharmacop&oelig;ia, says,
&ldquo;I see here directions for evaporating certain liquids
&lsquo;in a water-bath.&rsquo; Mr. Newcome, what is the most
familiar instance of a water-bath you are acquainted
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In High Holborn, sir; between Little Queen-street and
Drury-lane,&rdquo; returns Mr. Newcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A water-bath means a vessel placed in boiling-water. Mr.
Newcome, to keep it at a certain temperature. If you are asked at
the Hall for the most familiar instance, they like you to say a
carpenter&rsquo;s glue-pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in like manner the grinding-class proceeds.</p>

<h3>THE LORD MAYORS AND THE QUEEN.</h3>
<p class="cen"><em>By the Correspondent of the Observer.</em></p>
<p>The interesting condition of Her Majesty is a source of the most
agonising suspense to the Lord Mayors of London and Dublin, who, if
a Prince of Wales is not born before their period of office
expires, will lose the chance of being created baronets.</p>
<p>According to rumour, the baby&mdash;we beg pardon, the scion of
the house of Brunswick&mdash;was to have been born&mdash;we must
apologise again; we should say was to have been added to the
illustrious stock of the reigning family of Great
Britain&mdash;some day last month, and of course the present Lord
Mayors had comfortably made up their minds that they should be
entitled to the dignity it is customary to confer on such occasions
as that which the nation now ardently anticipates. But here we are
at the beginning of November, and no Prince of Wales. We have
reason to know that the Lord Mayor of London has not slept a wink
since Saturday, and his lady has not smiled, according to an
authority on which we are accustomed to rely, since Thursday
fortnight. Some say it is done on purpose, because the present
official is a Tory; and others insinuate that the Prince of Wales
is postponed in order that there may be an opportunity of making
Daniel O&rsquo;Connell a baronet. Others suggest that there will be
twins presented to the nation! one on the night of the 8th of
November, the other on the morning of the 9th, so as to conciliate
both parties; but we are not disposed at present to pronounce a
decided opinion on this part of the question. We know that politics
have been carried most indelicately into the very heart of the
Royal Household; but we hope, for the honour of all parties, that
the confinement of the Queen is not to be made a matter of
political arrangement. If it is, we can only say that it will be
most indecent, we might almost venture to say unbecoming; but our
dislike to the use of strong language is well known, or at least it
ought to be.</p>
<p>If there are any other particulars, we shall give them in a
second edition; that is to say, if we should have anything to add,
and should think it worth while to publish another impression for
the purpose of stating it.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>MISS ADELAIDE KEMBLE.</h3>
<p>Let every amateur, professor, and enthusiastic raver concerning
&ldquo;native talent&rdquo; go down on his knees, and, after the
manner of the ancient heathen, return thanksgiving unto Apollo for
having at last sent us a singer who knows her business! One who can
sing as if she had a soul; who can act as if she were not acting,
but existing amidst reality; who is, in short, a performer entirely
new to the British stage; to whom we have not a parallel example to
produce,&mdash;a heroine of the lyric drama.</p>
<p>Such, in the most exalted sense of the term, is Miss Adelaide
Kemble. Unlike nearly every other English singer, she has not set
up with the small stock-in-trade of a good voice, and learned
singing on the stage; making the public pay for her tuition. On the
contrary, nature has manifestly not been bountiful to her in this
respect. Her voice&mdash;the mere organ&mdash;may have been in her
earlier years exceeded in quality by many other vocalists. But what
is it now? Perfect in intonation; its lower tones forcible; the
middle voice firm and full; the upper interval sweet and rich
beyond comparison.</p>
<p>But how comes this? How has this moderately-good organ been
brought to such perfection? By a process not very prevalent amongst
English singers&mdash;practice the most constant, study the most
unwearied. Punch will bet a wager with any sporting dilettante that
Miss Kemble has sung <em>more</em> while learning her art, than
many old stagers while professing and practising it.</p>
<p>She seems, then,&mdash;as far as one may judge of that kind of
perfection&mdash;a perfect mistress of her voice; she can do what
she likes with it, she can sustain a note in any part of the
soprano compass&mdash;swell, diminish, and keep it exactly to the
same pitch for an incredible space of time. She can burst forth a
torrent of sound expressive of our strongest passions, without
losing an atom of tone, and she can diminish it to a whisper, in
<em>sotto voce</em>, as distinct as it is thrilling and true
intonation.</p>
<p>Having obtained this vocal mastery, she has unfettered energies
to devote to her acting; which, in <em>Norma</em>, has all the
elements of tragic dignity&mdash;all the tenderness of natural
feeling. In one word, Miss Kemble is a mistress of every branch of
her art; and we can now say, what we have so seldom had an
opportunity to boast of, that our English stage possesses a singer
who is also an actress and musician!</p>
<p>The opera is excellently put upon the stage. Miss Kemble, or
somebody else, electrified the choruses; for, wonderful to relate,
they condescended to act&mdash;to perform&mdash;to pretend to be
what they are meant for! Never was so efficient, so
well-disciplined, so unanimous a chorus heard or seen before on the
English stage. The chorus-master deserves everybody&rsquo;s, and
has our own, especial commendations.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h3>NINA SFORZA.</h3>
<p>A new melo-drama in five acts, by a gentleman who rejoices in
exactly the same number of titles&mdash;namely, &ldquo;R. Zouch S.
Troughton, Esquire&rdquo;&mdash;made its appearance for Miss H.
Fancit&rsquo;s benefit on Monday last, at the Haymarket.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned recipe for cooking up a melo-dramatic hero has
been strictly followed in &ldquo;Nina Sforza.&rdquo; <em>Raphael
Doria</em>, the heir-apparent to the dukedom of Genoa, is a man
about town in Venice&mdash;is accompanied, on most occasions, by a
faithful friend and a false one&mdash;saves the heroine from
drowning, and, of course, falls in love with her on the spot, or
rather on the water. She, of course, returns the passion; but is,
as usual, loved by the villain&mdash;a regular thorough-paced
Mephistopheles of the Surrey or Sadler&rsquo;s Wells genus. These
ingredients, having been carefully compounded in the first act,
are&mdash;quite <em>selon les r&egrave;gles</em>&mdash;allowed to
simmer till the end of the fourth, and to boil over in the fifth.
Thus we have a tragedy after the manner of those lively productions
that flourished in the time of Garrick; when Young, Murphy, and
Francklin were Melpomene&rsquo;s head-cooks.</p>
<p>Modern innovation has, however, added a sprinkle of spice to the
hashes of the above-named school. This is most commonly thrown in,
by giving to the stock-villain a dash of humour or sarcasm, so as
to bring out his savagery in bolder relief. He is also invested
with an unaccountable influence over the hero, who can on no
account be made to see his bare and open treachery till about the
middle of the fifth act, when the dupe&rsquo;s eyes must be opened
in time for the catastrophe.</p>
<p>These improvements have been carefully introduced into the
present old new tragedy. <em>Ugone Spinola</em> is the presiding
genius of <em>Doria&rsquo;s</em> woes: and dogs him about for the
pleasure of making him miserable. He is a finished epicure in
revenge; picking little tit-bits of it with the most savage
<em>g&ocirc;ut</em> all through; but particularly towards the end
of the play. This taste was, it seems, first acquired in
consequence of a feud that formerly existed between
<em>Doria&rsquo;s</em> family and his own, in which his side came
off so decidedly second-best, that he only remains of his race; all
the rest having been murdered by <em>Doria</em> and his
father&rsquo;s faction. From such deadly foes, it may be observed,
that tragic heroes always select their most trusted friends.</p>
<p><em>Doria&rsquo;s</em> father dies, and <em>Nina&rsquo;s</em>
consents to his marriage; so that we see them, at the opening of
the third act, the picture of connubial bliss, in a garden
belonging to the Duke&rsquo;s palace at Genoa, exchanging
sentiments which would be doubtless extremely tender if they were
quite intelligible. A great deal is said about genius being like
love; which gives rise to a simile touching a rose-bud in a poor
poet&rsquo;s window, and other incoherencies quite natural for
persons to utter who are supposed to be in love. This peaceful
scene is interrupted by an alarm of war; and the Prince goes to
fight the Florentines.</p>
<p>The battle takes place between the acts; and we next see the
Genoese halting near their city after a victory. <em>Doria</em>,
who in the first act has been represented to us as an exceedingly
gay young fellow, is here described as indulging, in his tent, his
old propensities; having brought away, with other trophies, a fair
Florentine, who is diverting him with her guitar at that moment.
This is excellent news for <em>Spinola</em>; the more so as we are
soon made to understand that <em>Nina</em>, being impatient of her
husband&rsquo;s return, has fled to his tent to meet him, and
discovers the fair Florentine in the very act of guitar-playing,
and her spouse in the midst of his raptures thereat.</p>
<p>A scene follows, in which <em>Spinola</em>, as a new edition of
Iago, and <em>Nina</em>, in the form of a female Othello, get scope
for a great variety of that kind of acting which performers call
&ldquo;effective.&rdquo; The wife&mdash;in this scene really
well-drawn&mdash;will not believe Doria&rsquo;s falsehood, in spite
of strong <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name=
"page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>circumstantial evidence.
<em>Spinola</em> offers to strengthen it; and the last scene of
this act&mdash;the fourth&mdash;presents a highly melo-dramatic
situation. It is a street scene; and <em>Spinola</em> has brought
<em>Nina</em> to watch her husband into her rival&rsquo;s house.
She sees him approach it&mdash;he wavers&mdash;she hopes he will
pass the door. Alas, he does not, and actually goes in! Of course
she swoons and falls. So does the act drop.</p>
<p>The entire business of the last act is to bring about the
catastrophe; and, as not one step towards it has been previously
taken, there is no time to lose. <em>Spinola</em>, therefore, is
made not to mince the matter, but to come boldly on at once, with a
bottle of poison! This he blandly insinuates to <em>Nina</em> might
be used with great effect upon her husband, so as effectually to
put a stop to future intrigues with any forthcoming fair
Florentines. She, however, declines putting the poison to any such
use; but, nevertheless, honours <em>Spinola</em>&rsquo;s draught,
by accepting it. The villain expresses himself extremely grateful
for her condescension, and exits, to make way for
<em>Doria</em>.</p>
<p>Directly he appears, you at once perceive that he has done
something exceedingly naughty, for his countenance is covered with
remorse and a certain white powder which is the stage specific for
pallor. The lady complains of being unwell, and her husband kindly
advises her to go to bed. She replies, that she has a cordial
within which will soon restore her, and entreats her beloved lord
to administer the potion with his own dear hand; he
consents&mdash;and they both retire, and the audience shudders,
because they pretty well guess that she is going to toss off the
dose, of which <em>Spinola</em> has been the dispensing
chemist.</p>
<p>And here we may be forgiven for a short digression on the
subject of the dramatic <em>Materia Medica</em>, and
<em>poison-ology</em>. The sleeping draughts of the stage are, for
example, generally speaking, uncommon specimens of chemical
perfection. When taken&mdash;even if the patient be ever so well
shaken&mdash;nothing on earth, or on the stage, can wake him after
the cue for his going to sleep, and before the cue for his getting
up, have been given; while it never allows him to dose an instant
longer than the plot of the piece requires. Then as to poisons;
there are some which kill the taker dead on the spot, like a fly in
a bottle of prussic acid; others, which&mdash;swallowed with a sort
of time-bargain&mdash;are warranted to do the business within a few
seconds of so many hours hence; others again there are
(particularly adapted for villains) that cause the most incessant
torment, which nothing can relieve but death; a fourth compound
(always administered to such characters as <em>Nina Sforza</em>)
are peculiarly mild in their operation&mdash;no
stomach-ache&mdash;no contortions&mdash;but still effectual.</p>
<p>The contents of the phial given to <em>Nina</em> by
<em>Spinola</em> are compounded of the second and fourth of these
<em>formul&aelig;</em>. The drink, though deadly, is guaranteed to
be a mild, rather-pleasant-than-otherwise poison, warranted to
operate at a given hour; one calculated to allow the heroine plenty
of time to die, and to make her go off in great physical
comfort.</p>
<p><em>Nina</em> has taken the poison; but, having a peculiar
desire to die at home, orders a &ldquo;trusty page&rdquo; to
provide horses for herself and attendant secretly, at the northern
gate, that she may return to her native Venice. With this
determination we lose sight of her.</p>
<p><em>Doria</em> is aroused by a hunting-party who have risen so
early that they seem to have forgotten to take off their nightcaps,
to which the Italian hood, as worn by the Haymarket hunters, bears
an obstinate resemblance. The Prince discovers his wife has fled,
and orders his <em>chasseurs</em> to divert their attention from
the game they had purposed to ride to cover for, and to hunt up the
missing <em>Nina</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the deep recesses of a wood&rdquo; <em>Spinola</em>
and <em>Doria</em> meet, the latter having, by some instinct, found
out his <em>pseudo</em>-friend&rsquo;s treachery; of course they
fight: <em>Doria</em> falls; but <em>Spinola</em> is too great a
glutton in revenge to kill him till he knows of his wife&rsquo;s
death, so, after gloating over his prostrate enemy, and poking him
about with his rapier for several minutes, all he does is to steal
his sword; this being found upon him by some of the hunters, who
meet him quite by accident, they suppose he has killed
<em>Doria</em>, and so kill him. Thus, <em>Spinola</em> being
disposed of, there are only two more that are left to die.</p>
<p>In her flight <em>Nina</em> has been taken unwell&mdash;with the
poison&mdash;just in that part of the forest where her spouse is
left, by his enemy, in a swoon. They meet, and she dies in his
arms. Two being now defunct, only one remains; but there is some
difficulty in getting rid of <em>Doria</em>, for he is (as is
always the case when a stage <em>felo-de-se</em> impends)
unprovided with a weapon. Going up to his trusty friend
<em>D&rsquo;Estala</em>, he engages him in talk, and, with the
dexterity of a footpad, steals his dagger, and stabs himself. All
the principal characters being now dead, the piece cannot go on,
and the curtain drops.</p>
<p>A word or two on the merits of <em>Nina Sforza</em>. There are
two classes of dramatists who are just now contending for
fame&mdash;those who cannot get their plays acted because they are
not dramatic, and those who can, because their pieces are
<em>merely</em> dramatic. Mr.&mdash;we beg pardon, R. Zouch S.
Troughton, Esquire,&mdash;belongs to the latter class. He is
evidently well acquainted with the mechanics of the stage; he knows
all about &ldquo;situation&rdquo;&mdash;that is, sacrificing nature
to startling effect. His language is essentially dramatic, and only
fails where it aims at being poetical. His characters, too, are not
drawn from life, from nature, but are copied&mdash;and cleverly
copied&mdash;from other characters that strut about in the
&ldquo;stock&rdquo; tragedies of Rowe <em>et hoc genus</em>. The
fable, or plot, is deficient, from the absence of one sustaining,
pervading incident to excite, and keep up a progressive interest.
With every new act a new circumstance arises, which, though it is
in some instances (especially in the fourth act) conducted with
great skill, yet the interest it produces is not sustained, being
made to give place to the author&rsquo;s succeeding effort to get
up a new &ldquo;situation&rdquo; by a new incident. Though the
tragedy possesses little originality, it will, from its
melo-dramatic and exciting character, be most likely a very
successful one. Besides, it is very well acted, by Miss Faucit,
Wallack, and Macready, as <em>Spinola</em>; which, being a most
unnatural character, is well calculated for so conventional an
actor as Macready.</p>
<p>The author will doubtless become a successful dramatist, because
he has taken the trouble to learn what is proper for, and effective
on, the stage. Having gained that acquirement, if he will now study
nature, and put men and women upon the stage that act and speak
like real mortals, we may safely predict an honourable dramatic
career for Mr. &mdash;&mdash;; but our space is limited, and we
can&rsquo;t afford enough of it to print his names a third
time.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h3>THE QUADROON SLAVE.</h3>
<p>A new discussion of the Slave question seems to have been much
wanted on the stage. It is, alas, the black truth that &ldquo;The
Slave&rdquo; <em>par excellence</em>, in spite of the brothers
<em>Sharpset</em> and Bishop&rsquo;s music, ceases to interest. The
woes of &ldquo;Gambia&rdquo; have been turned into ridicule by the
capers of &ldquo;Jim Crow,&rdquo; and the twin pleasantries of
&ldquo;Jim along Josey.&rdquo; Since the moral British public gave
away twenty millions to emancipate the black population, and to
raise the price of brown sugars, they are not nearly so sweet upon
the niggers as formerly; for they discover that, now C&aelig;sar
being &ldquo;massa-pated, him no work&mdash;dam if he
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To meet this dramatic exigency, the &ldquo;Quadroon Slave&rdquo;
has been produced. It may be classed as an argumentative drama;
carried on with that stage logic which always makes the heroine get
the best of it. The emancipation side of the question is supported
by <em>Julie</em>, ably backed by <em>Vincent St. George</em>, but
opposed by <em>Alfred Pelham</em>; and the lingual combatants rush
<em>in medias res</em> at the very rising of the curtain&mdash;the
&ldquo;house,&rdquo; immediately taking sides, vehemently
applauding the arguments of their respective favourites.
<em>Vincent St. George</em>&mdash;ably entrusted to that
interesting advocate Mr. J. Webster&mdash;opened the discussion by
protesting against the flogging system, especially as applied to
females. <em>Alfred Pelham</em> answered him; the reply being taken
up by the heroine <em>Julie</em> in broken French, because she is
personated by Madlle. Celeste. The state of parties as here
developed turns out to be curious. The heroine, a quadroon, is on
the point of matrimonial union with her antagonist, and openly
resents the tender advances of her ally. &ldquo;Call ye this
backing of your friends?&rdquo; <em>Vincent St. George</em>,
disgusted at such gross tergiversation, flies entirely away from
the point at issue, and applies those remarks to <em>Julie</em>
which all disappointed lovers seem to be bound to utter in such
cases. Indeed, on the re-appearance of his rival, he challenges
him&mdash;unblushingly forsaking every branch of the main point, by
engaging in a long and not very lively discourse on the subject of
duelling; amidst, however, impatient cries of
&ldquo;question!&rdquo; &ldquo;question!&rdquo; from the
audience.</p>
<p>This brings <em>Vincent</em> back to the point, and with a
vengeance! Like a great many other orators on the liberal side of
the black question, he is a slave-owner himself, having&mdash;as
his &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; <em>Vipper</em> is careful to tell
us&mdash;no fewer than two hundred and eight of those animals. Now,
before he took upon himself to become an emancipationist, he
might&mdash;one cannot help thinking&mdash;have had the
decency&mdash;<em>like Saint Fowell Buxton</em>&mdash;to
<em>sell</em> his slaves to somebody else, and to come into court
with clean hands. But so far from doing so, <em>Vipper</em> having
discovered that <em>Julie</em> is a run-away slave from
<em>Vincent&rsquo;s</em> estate, just as she is ending the first
act by going to be married, the latter takes the whole of the
second act to claim her!</p>
<p>Though the argufiers change sides on account of the change of
affairs&mdash;<em>Vincent</em> insisting, as <em>liberals</em> so
often do, upon his vested rights in <em>Julie</em> as opposed to
<em>Pelham&rsquo;s</em> matrimonial ones&mdash;though the heroine
renders her pathetics affecting by a prostration or two before the
rivals&mdash;though she rushes upon a parapet to commit
suicide&mdash;though she is saved, and at length succeeds by force
of mere argument to get her new-found master to give her up to her
husband; yet this second act was somewhat dull; insomuch that the
audience did not seem to regret when the curtain dropped the
subject, and announced their own emancipation from the theatre.</p>
<p>Besides the parts we have named, Webster the elder played a
<em>Telemachus Hearty</em>, who, further than skipping about the
stage, talking very fast, and making himself not altogether
disagreeable, had no more to do with the piece than his namesake,
or F&eacute;n&eacute;lon Archbishop of Cambray himself.</p>
<p>This attempt to discuss moot points upon the stage&mdash;to turn
as it were the theatre into a debating society&mdash;will certainly
not succeed. Audiences&mdash;especially Haymarket ones&mdash;have a
taste for being amused rather than reasoned with; besides, those on
that side of the question which the author chooses shall be the
weaker, do not like to see the stage-orators get the upper hand,
without having a chance of answering them. Even dancing is
preferred by them to didactics, though it be</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
